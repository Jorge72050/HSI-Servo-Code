# Project Overview

The prosthetic team at LHNT aims to develop a functional prosthetic hand, similar to real-life medical prosthetics through the actuation, 3D modeling, and hardware-software integration teams. The prosthetic hand currently has one degree of freedom, being an open and closed hand, but we aim to achieve mobility in each finger. These movements are performed through a WiFi connection, where we can manually select 'buttons' on the IP website generated from the ESP32 to open and close the hand.
